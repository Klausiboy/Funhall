# Funhall

A project that I started developing based on a case from the company Funhall in Viborg. Funhall is an eventcenter, where people can experience all sorts of activities. Funhall wanted an app that would let them manage their events and generate teams and tournament plans for certain events.

The app is in very early stages of development
