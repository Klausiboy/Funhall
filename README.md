# Funhall

A project that I started developing based on a case from the company Funhall in Viborg. Funhall is an eventcenter, where people can experience all sorts of activities. Funhall wanted an app that would let them manage their events and generate teams and tournament plans for certain events.

The app is in very early stages of development. remember to run the command "npm install" if cloning the project to download the Node-modules required for angular. These modules take up a lot of space, so the have been ignored for the git

A simple visual prototype was developped together with the owner of Funhall, and it can be viewed here https://xd.adobe.com/view/f4dde1b3-d89c-4277-54e4-fcc8b0c44d71-82ec/
